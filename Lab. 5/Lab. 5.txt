Create a login/signup form.

If the user not logged in, the login form is displayed (username and password).

A link leads users to a signup page, where they can create an account.
Don't forget to confirm the password.
Store user in database, making sure the password is encoded (e.g. MD5 hash).
Each user should have a unique identifier (see AUTO_INCREMENT in MySQL).

From the login form, the user can login using username password.
Display welcome message upon login along with logout button.
Logging out should return to login form.
