Sydney's hotels and Ho Chi Minh's hotels are not implemented yet. There are templates inside the view folder but for now the user can't
see these hotels.

Travel's subtitles are not implemented yet.

We decided to implement templates for travel's content description in order not to overload the database with massive text description.
Travel's templates have the same title as the travel they refer to.
