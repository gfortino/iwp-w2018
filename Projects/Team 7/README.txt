Hi, here is the project README

The project is a website which sells items (from the video game industry) 

On the main page you can find the list of games that we sell.
By clicking on the picture you can access at the page from the game.
You can find more information about the game and choose to return on the main page or to buy the game.
You can then click on the "ajouter à votre panier" and the item will enter your cart.
or you can choose to remove one entity of the game from your cart.
Then you'll be send to the main page where you can go and see more game or just go to see your cart.
In the cart page you will see the total price and the price of each item you chosed at this moment.
